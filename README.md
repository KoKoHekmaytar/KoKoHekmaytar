## 🔬 About Me

I work on **data-driven modeling and control for soft robotic systems**, combining:

- Koopman Operator Theory
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- ROS 2 based real-time control systems
- Multi-motor cable-driven actuation
- OptiTrack motion capture integration

My recent work focuses on building an end-to-end pipeline including:

- 📷 Vision-based state estimation  
- 🎛 Multi-motor embedded control (ESP32 / I2C / PID)  
- 🧠 Koopman-based predictive modeling  
- 🚀 Real-time closed-loop control
